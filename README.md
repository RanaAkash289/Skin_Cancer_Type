# Skin_Cancer_Type

Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive machine learning system for the early detection and prediction of skin cancer, employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our model integrates sophisticated image processing and feature extraction methods to recognize complex patterns associated with various types of skin cancer. By capturing temporal dependencies through LSTM, we enhance our model's ability to predict the evolution of skin lesions based on patient history, significantly boosting its diagnostic accuracy.

Methodology
The model architecture includes several layers designed to process and learn from dermatoscopic images:

Input Layer: Handles raw pixel data from input images.
Convolutional Layers: Extract features by applying filters to the input.
Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality and preserve essential information.
LSTM Layers: Analyze time-dependent patterns for better context understanding.
Fully Connected Layers: Interpret features to perform classification.
Output Layer: Provides probabilities of the presence of various skin cancer types.
Training was conducted on the HAM10000 dataset, a robust collection of dermatoscopic images representing a diverse set of skin conditions.

Results
Our model achieved impressive results, distinguishing itself in the following areas:

Precision and Accuracy: The system demonstrated high precision and an accuracy rate of 94% in identifying and classifying various skin cancer types.
Interpretability and Integration: The model outputs are interpretable, allowing healthcare providers to understand the diagnostic reasoning. Additionally, the system is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing healthcare infrastructure.
Conclusion
The successful implementation of this model represents a significant advancement in the use of artificial intelligence for medical diagnostics, particularly in the early detection of skin cancer. Our approach not only reduces the need for invasive biopsy procedures but also ensures that patients receive timely and accurate diagnoses, ultimately improving patient care outcomes.
